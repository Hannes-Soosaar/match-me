    A user can match with self.
    When you close all tabs and windows localstorage is not cleared.  handele Using BroadcastChannel (Modern Approach)

 
    When a new user is created and they switch to mathches they will see a match score of 0 with everyone. The score is recalculated when you login.

TODO- Landing page to  Dashboard  unless initial loading.
TODO- Add interests to View profile
TODO- check layout on mobile.
TODO- Matches to be visible on Dashboard
TODO - Describe matching logic. -- HANNES 
TODO -  The user experience is excellent, usable and well designed.
WIP- if buddied be able to open chat. // view profile


// OPTIONAL

TODO - Match notification. ? is this needed..
TODO - API documentation. for minimum API DEV.


// API DEV. CHECK

CHECK -The me endpoints correctly shortcuts to the appropriate users endpoint.
/users/{id}: which returns the user's name and link to the profile picture.
/users/{id}/profile: which returns the users "about me" type information.
/users/{id}/bio: which returns the users biographical data (the data used to power recommendations).
/me: which is a shortcut to /users/{id} for the authenticated user. You should also implement /me/profile and /me/bio.
/users/{id}/bio:

TODO- The users endpoint returns a name and profile link. ( make /users  and make it return name and profile link)
TODO- The connections endpoint only returns a list of ids. (make /connections return a list of ID's )
TODO- The recommendations endpoint only returns a list of ids. (make /recommendations return a list of ID's )
TODO- The bio endpoint returns biographical data. (make /bio  return biographical data)
TODO- This includes when the user is not allowed to see a profile. This is not quite how HTTP404 is described, but it means that a bad actor cannot distinguish between "does not exist", and "has blocked the user".

// EXTRAS



----------CHECK--------------
CHECK - Create two users in an empty system with obviously poor matching characteristics. Check to make sure that they are not recommended.
